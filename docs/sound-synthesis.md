# Sound Synthesis

In sound synthesis, complex waves are generated by algorithms of some type:

- [[modulation-synthesis|Modulation Synthesis]]
  - [[ring-modulation|Ring Modulation]]
  - [[frequency-modulation|Frequency Modulation]]
  - Amplitude Modulation
- Karplus Strong
  - Loading up a buffer of noise and filtering it
- [[granular-synthesis|Granular Synthesis]]
- Physical Modeling

[[spectral-composition|Spectral composers]] adapt these synthesis techniques to compute 'symbolic spectra' (pitch sets) rather than, or in addition to, audio signals.
