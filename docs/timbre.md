# Timbre

**Timbre** is the "color" or quality of [[sound-waves|sounds]].

- related to [[sound-waves|sound]] quality
- specified by qualitative adjectives (e.g. bright or dull)

## Perception

> Timbre is "attribute of auditory sensation in terms of which a listener can judge that two sounds are dissimilar, when the two sounds are similarly presented having the same loudness, pitch, and duration." (Acoustical Society of America, ASA).

Timbre is usually separated conceptually from [[pitch]] and loudness.

- our ability to distinguish between sounds relies on our perception of a sound's timbre over time
