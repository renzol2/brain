# Fourier Theorem

_Theorem_:

> Any periodic waveform can be expressed as a sum of sinusoidal vibrations ([[sine-wave|sine waves]])

Every period wave consists of:

- a fundamental [[frequency]]
  - the fundamental is the lowest frequency that is present in a complex vibration
  - if the fundamental is the _only_ frequency present in the waveform, we are dealing with a [[sine-wave|sine wave]]
- some number of **overtones**

All these sine waves are collectively called **partials**

- A fundamental is a partial
- An overtone is a partial
- A fundamental is _not_ an overtone

## In Sound

The Fourier Theorem can be applied to [[sound-waves|sound waves]].

> Any **sound** comprised of a periodic waveform can be expressed as a sum of ([[sine-wave|sine waves]])
