# Electro-Mechanical Recording

**Electro-Mechanical Recording** is the hybrid [[recording]] process that combines [[mechanical-recording|mechanical recording]] techniques with technological advances in electronics.

- technological advances enable amplification and filtering of sound via electronic means
- availability of [[microphones]] for more sensitive/accurate capture
  - ([[condenser-microphones|condenser microphones]], ca. 1916)
- disc-cutting; electrically driven mechanical process

Electro-mechanical recording led to

- significant improvements in [[dynamic-range|dynamic range]] and [[frequency-response|frequency response]] of hardware devices in both recording and playback.
- the integrated electrical recording system, introduced by **Western Electric** ca. 1925
  - supply/research branch at AT&T
  - co-founded [[bell-laboratories|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], 1925
- concept of **_audio engineering_**
