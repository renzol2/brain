# Square Wave

A **square wave** is a periodic waveform characterized by its square-like shape and binary, discrete nature.

## Sound

A square wave is formed by summing only the odd [[partial]]s of the [[harmonic-series|harmonic series]], where each of the odd harmonic's [[amplitude]] is inversely proportional to its [[frequency]].

The [[timbre]] of a square wave is distinctly hollow, like a clarinet or closed-end organ pipe
