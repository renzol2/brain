# Kulintang

The **kulintang** is an instrument consisting of a set of eight bossed-gongs in graduated sizes arranged from lowest to highest [[pitch]] and laid over a (typically) wooden frame.

- played by striking the knob of the gong with wooden sticks
- played at moderate to fast tempos with little to no rests and no sustained notes

The kulintang is part of an instrumental ensemble along with other gongs and a skin drum, which are common among the [[Mindanao]] region of southern [[Philippines]].

The region contains different styles of kulintang playing across different regions, each with their own distinct styles of playing.

## Playing Techniques

Kulintang is typically played with _softwood sticks_. Depending on the weight and material of the sticks, the kulintang could have a harder or softer sound.

Traditional techniques:

- single strokes (simply striking the gongs)
- double strokes
- _sabay_: two notes at once
- grace notes
- damping the gongs
- ostinato (drone)
- hitting with the middle or end of a stick to produce different tones
- hitting the rim of the gong produces a sharper, more metal-sounding tone

Non-traditional techniques:

- playing 2 notes with one stick
- changing gongs in the middle of the piece to change the mode/tuning/feel mid-piece
  - takes a few seconds; can't do it while playing
- using sticks with rubber ends, like those for agung or gandingan, for a different and _rounder_ tone

## Tuning

The kulintang set consists of 8 gongs laid in a row, with _no strict [[tuning-systems|tuning]]_, since the music style doesn't actually need a strict tuning system. However, there are broad conventions for the tuning of kulintang.

Traditionally, kulintang is tuned in pentatonic scale without a strict pitch center.

- doesn't matter if it's a major, minor, or even modal scale
- is generally roughly pentatonic
- usually, gong 3 is the pitch center

Kulintang players choose gongs that would fit the aesthetic of the music style

- [[music-composition|composers]] and performers cannot just choose 8 random pitches in order
- knowing how to choose the appropriate tunings will come after listening to plenty of music examples

### Examples of traditional tunings

The following tunings are laid out in the following format:

`[rough pitch relative to TET tuning]` (perceived Western mode)

`G A C D E G A C` (C major pentatonic)

- common in the University of the Philippines - College of Music
- Kulintang master Kanapia Kalanduyan tuned several kulintang sets in the college this way

`G A C# D E G A C` (A mixolydian?)

- Harold Andre heard this tuning in a Maranao video once

`G A C D Eb G A C` (C dorian?)

- Master Aga Mayo Butocan owns a kulintang set with this tuning
- no exact "key center" in the Western sense

`A B D E F A B D` (D dorian?)

- same as last example, just transposed

`A Bb D E F A Bb D` (D minor, A phrygian)

- Harold Andre's personal favorite
- [[Maguindanao]] pieces often have long-lasting ostinatos on gongs 1 and 2, making them extra spicy

`A Bb D Eb F A Bb D` (D phrygian, A locrian)

- this scale is more commonly heard in Javanese music

## Improvisation

Kulintang music is **highly improvised!**.

- all the rhythmic frenzy by kulintang master performers in recordings and live performances are all _improv_

Kulintang players are not taught strict, written pieces, but rather taught how to improvise on _rhythmic patterns_.

- difficult to develop a "feel" for kulintang rhythmic modes or patterns
- understanding these patterns takes practice and listening

## Maguindanao Style

The [[Maguindanao]] playing style is said to depict the "rippling waves of the sea"

- **rapid** and **fierce**

## Similarities across cultures

Many people relate kulintang to instruments in other cultures, such as the

- _bonang_ of Indonesian gamelan ensemble
- _khong wong yai_ in Thai music
- _kyi waing_ in Burmese music

Unlike these gong instruments, the kulintang has a much [[envelope|faster decay of sound. Its sustain is not as long]], resulting in pieces being played in moderate to fast tempos with little to no rests.

## Learning Nuances

- Harold Andre (Manila-based musician) learned under a Maguindanaon master (Professor Aga Mayo Butocan) in Tagalog, meaning he was taught in Tagalog (his language) and not in Maguindanaon (her language)
- she has crafted a way to teach kulintang in an academic setting
- not a strictly traditional way of teaching, so there may be lost nuance
