# Decolonization

**Decolonization** is the undoing and dismantling of [[colonialism]] and colonial status.

- refers to all liberation from colonial control and authority, whether over our lands, communities, bodies, or minds (Derrick Quevedo, @drrckqvdo)
- an ongoing process that involves radical, fundamental changes to complete dismantling of current oppressive systems founded by historical [[colonization]]
