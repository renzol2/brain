# Audio Level Standards

**Audio level standards** determine the appropriate level for [[audio-signal|audio signals]] passing through a signal chain.

There are four main standard levels, from lowest to highest average voltage:

1. Mic level
2. Instrument level
3. Line level
4. Speaker level

## Mic Level

Output from [[microphones]] & instrument pickups are usually at **mic level**.

- weakest level by many magnitudes
- requires reamplification to line level for further signal processing
- between 0.5 - 8 mV (~60 dB less than line level)

## Instrument Level

Output from electric guitar/bass and some [[analog-synthesizers|synthesizers]] are usually at **instrument level**.

- generally slightly lower than line level
- actual level varies by device

## Line Level

Output from mixers, interfaces, laptops, TVs, game systems, smartphones, media players, and most analog equipment are at **line level**.

- typical ranges from 0.25 - 1.75 V

## Speaker Level

Output from signal amplifiers are at **speaker level**.

- strongest audio signal level
- intended for loudspeaker drivers only
- approx. 10-100 V
- varies by amplifier

## Compatibility Issues

Certain compatibility issues arise when converting between different levels:

- $x$ level signal to $x$ level input is ok
- _low_ level signal to _high_ level input:
  - low level or noisy signal
  - poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
- _high_ level signal to _low_ level input:
  - signal distortion
  - possible equipment damage
