# DAO

**DAO**s, or **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**s, are decentralized groups of individuals that run companies on [[web3]].

- No CEOs or presidents
- hierarchy determined by # of tokens (cryptocurrency)
- changed made through voting, with those at the top of hierarchy having more influence
- no censorship by [[big-tech]]; one controlling authority cannot shut down content
