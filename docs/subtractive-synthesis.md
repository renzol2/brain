# Subtractive Synthesis

Subtractive synthesis is the process of generating [[sound-waves|sound]] by using filters on broadband [[noise]] to create various [[spectrum|spectra]].

- filters attenuate spectral regions from a source sound
- filters are often highly selective and/or used in series
- noise generators as tone generators
