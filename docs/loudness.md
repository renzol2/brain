# Loudness

**Loudness** is a subjective perception of [[sound-waves|sound]] based primarily on [[amplitude]]/power/intensity, but also [[frequency]]

- closely related to amplitude
- a perceived doubling of loudness â†’ depends on the person
- approximately 9-10 dB

Loudness is measured in units of **phons** (perceived loudness)

As humans, our perception is subject to certain [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] phenomena.

- have less sensitivity to **low** and **high** frequencies.
- have greater sensitivity between **2kHz** and **5kHz** (human talking range) due to the structure/length of our ear canal

The wavelengths of these frequencies aligns with most people's ear canals, so our ear canals go into resonance when these frequencies are present in sound we listen to
