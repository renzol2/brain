# Dynamic Range Processing

**Dynamic Range**: Difference between highest/lowest level (dB) of an audio signal

A _dynamic range process_ (DRP) changes a signal's dynamic range by altering its amplitude.

- measuring signal amplitude
- adjusts signal amplitude based on measured value

Measured & processed signals can be the same or different

Applications include:

- maintaining a constant signal level
- increasing the overall level of a mix
- creative transient shaping
- noise reduction
- preventing clipping/overloading
- side-chaining (amplitude following, ducking)

## Key Concepts

All forms of DRP rely on an amplitude **threshold**.

- determines signal level above or below which DRP take effect, depending on the type of effect

DRPs utilize a **detection circuit**or **detection algorithm** for tracking signal amplitude, which can track either *peak* or *average* signal level

**Peak**: instantaneous measurement, captures true waveform peaks

**Average**: signal values averaged over a time interval, also called *RMS* (root-mean-squared) tracking

Peak tracking is more applicable for preventing overloading/clipping.

RMS tracking provides a smoother response to a changing input signal.
