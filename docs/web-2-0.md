# Web 2.0

A period of the internet from 2004 and ongoing, where:

- data is consumed and produced by users
- the majority of data on the internet is stored by only a few companies in [[big-tech]], leading to heavy centralization
- data is sold by companies to advertisers

The following changes from **Web 1.0** ([[web-1-0]]) were made:

- users became **producers** of content, as well as consumers
- content and data was uploaded to and held by centralized companies, becoming [[big-tech]] (Apple, Facebook, Google, etc.)
- data was sold to advertisers, leading to **targeted advertising** and lack of privacy
- content on your feed becomes personalized to your specific account

This centralization of data is leading to a new, less-centralized vision of the web: [[Web3]].
