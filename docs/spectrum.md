# Spectrum

## Sound

A **sound spectrum** is a representation of sound in terms of [[frequency]].

- usually presented as a 2-D graph of power or pressure (ex. [[decibel]]s) as a function of frequency
- displays the intensity of each frequency, usually within the human audible spectrum of 20Hz - 20kHz

A single instance of a sound spectrum is called a _spectra_.
