# Pitch Detection Algorithm

A **pitch detection algorithm (PDA)** is an [[algorithm]] that estimates the fundamental [[pitch]] of a signal, usually that of a musical note or tone. There is no ideal PDA, so several algorithms exist.

- within the [[frequency]] domain, [[fast-fourier-transform|FFTs]] are often used for their fast [[runtime]]
- **YAAPT** (yet another algorithm for pitch tracking) algorithm uses a combination of time and frequency domain processing combined with [[dynamic-programming|dynamic programming]] to find the most likely fundamental
